# Data Analytics Project Readme

## Overview

This Data Analytics Project is designed to simulate the steps I would take in a data analyst role. It incorporates techniques and methods covered in Power Query, SQL, Data Visualisation in Tableau, and Excel sessions. The project involves selecting a dataset, analysing it, and presenting findings through SQL queries, data visualization, and Excel calculations.

## Dataset Selection

For this project, I was required to choose one dataset.

## Repository Contents

My Github repository should include the following:

1. **SQL Code**: SQL queries used for data analysis and extraction from the chosen dataset.
2. **Data Visualisation**: Visual representations of the data analysis findings using tools like Tableau, Matplotlib, or any other preferred tool.
3. **Write-up/PowerPoint**: A document summarising the project, including an overview of the dataset, methodology, key findings, and insights derived from the analysis.
4. **Excel Calculations**: Any additional calculations or analysis performed in Excel, if applicable.

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and relationships.
2. **SQL Analysis**: Write SQL queries to extract relevant data, perform aggregations, and derive insights from the dataset.
3. **Data Visualisation**: Create visualisations to present key findings and trends discovered during the analysis.
4. **Excel Analysis**: Perform any additional calculations or analysis in Excel to complement the SQL and data visualization findings.
5. **Documentation**: Document the entire project process, including dataset exploration, SQL queries, data visualisation, Excel analysis, and final insights.

## Sharing

Once the project is completed and uploaded to Github, share the Github repository and upload onto Niyo Bootcamp learning platform ready to be presented at the Niyo Bootcamp Talent Expo Day.
